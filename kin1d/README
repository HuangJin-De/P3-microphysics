Before running the 1d kinematic cloud model, set up the following:

1. Link the source directory containing the P3 lookup tables to the local ./lookup_tables

2. Link/copy the P3 source file '../code_p3/module_mp_p3.f90' to the local ./mp_p3.f90.
   Link/copy the kin1D files (cld1d.f90, execld.f90, routinesCld1d.f90) to the main directory.

3. Modify the ./Makefile as necessary, with proper FORTRAN compiler and desired compiler options.

4. Modify driving model ./cld1d.f90 as necessary, with desired P3 version and options.


To run the 1d kinematic model, use the Makefile to compile the various components:

% make execld

To run:
% ./execld

Various output files (e.g. fort.100) are created.  The desired output can be modified in the driver program, cld1d.f90.
The output file ./out_p3.dat can be used as input file for the plotting script ./plot_1col.py to create Hovmoller plots.

A python plotting script is provided in the subdirectory ./plots. To insert a title to plot, either modify the plot script 
or add the title as a command line argument when running the script:
% python3 plot_1col.py 'My title'

To remove all .o files and output:
% make clean
