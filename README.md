# Predicted Particle Properties (P3) Microphysics Scheme

This repository contains the latest version(s) of the P3 microphysics scheme and associated components. The package includes the main P3 Fortran module and the lookup tables (text files), all of which are necessary to run with P3 in any model.  It also contains the code necessary to generate the lookup tables, a simple 1D kinematic model (interfaced with P3), and other various things.

Further details of the P3 scheme and this repository will be added in the near future.
