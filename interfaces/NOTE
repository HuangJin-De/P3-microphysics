The following subdirectories contain the model interface files that have been modified from
the pristine versions in the model library (for a particular version of that model) that need 
to be included in the compilation for the version of P3 indicated (plus the version of
'microphy_p3.f90', whose name (or extension) may needs to be changed for the given model.

If the current version of P3 is already in the official model library, the interface files
are not included in this repository.  The only purpose of this directory is to include the
necessary files to run the latest version of P3 in a particular version of a model for which
this version of P3 is not in the release version of the model.
