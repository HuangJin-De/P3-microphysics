The following subdirectories contain the GEM interface files that have been modified from
the pristine versions in the GEM library (for a particular version of GEM) that need to be
included in the compilation of GEM for the version of P3 indicated (plus the version of
'microphy_p3.f90', whose extension needs to be changed to .F90 for GEM)..

MISCELLANEOUS:

- the interface for P3_v4.3.3 is the same as for P3_v4.4.0

For code-p3_5.1.1.3-gem_5.1.1 takes all files in code-p3_5.1.1-gem_5.1.1
except for condensation.F90 and condensation_prt.hf

For code-p3_5.1.1.3-gem_5.2.0-a19 takes all files in code-p3_5.1.1-gem_5.2.0-a19
except for condensation.F90 and condensation_prt.hf and microphy_utils.F90
 
code-p3_5.1.1.4-gem_x --> also good with 5.1.1.4.1
